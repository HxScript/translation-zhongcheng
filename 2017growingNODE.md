# 2017年，Node.js生态圈正蓬勃发展！以下10点足以说明一切！标签（空格分隔）： 未分类我们开门见山：2017，是node.js社区的丰收年。在2017年，node.js逐渐走向成熟，并在企业中得到了广泛的认可和应用。同时，node.js自身也添加了许多优秀的新特性，如async/await（js异步大杀器），以及http2（）……Our favorite platform has finally matured to be widely adopted in the enterprise, also, a lot of great features have been merged into the core, like async/await & http2, just to mention a few.> 这个世界在node.js上运行。 [#全球node开发者交流大会](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NodeInteractive?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)> ![2017node开发者交流大会][1]这里需要更换一张图片> — Franziska Hinkelmann (@fhinkel) [October 4, 2017](https://twitter.com/fhinkel/status/915603328607727621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)（译者注：软件工程博士，谷歌v8引擎开发团队工程师，Node.js技术指导委员会成员。这样牛逼的身份，而其twitter照片竟然是个萌妹子。）**node.js的开发者们，不仅为node的枝繁叶茂做出了贡献，同时也创作了一系列关于node的优秀的学习资料。****Not only the developers who contribute to Node make this platform so great, but those who create learning materials around it were also exceptional.**在我们社区的最后一片文章中，我们收集了许多由node社区写的长文，我们从Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter & Medium等网站上获取数据，搜索最高点击、最多分享、最多喜欢的文章。我们故意避开了RisingStack（一个node服务公司）的文章，如果你对这些文章感兴趣， [清单！回顾2017年node技术文章的TOP15！](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-most-popular-node-js-tutorials-of-2017/)In our final article of 2017, we collected a bunch of longreads which were created by the Node community. We used data from Reddit, Hacker News, Twitter & Medium to search for the most read, most shared & liked stuff out there. We intentionally omitted articles written by RisingStack (except 1, couldn't resist) - if you're interested in those, [please visit our top15 of 2017 post](https://blog.risingstack.com/the-most-popular-node-js-tutorials-of-2017/)!> 我很确信，这些都是相当鹅妹嘤的文章。但如果你关心的内容没有在这个top15中出现，请给我们留言。> I'm sure we left a bunch of amazing articles out - so if you'd like to get attention to an exceptional one you read, please let us know in the comments section.同时，你也应该明白，这份清单并非传统意义上的“最佳”清单，它仅仅是一个集合，展示了node社区在2017年的发展有多鹅妹嘤！我认为，对于那些坚持不懈地推广node、分享node知识的开发者来说，这篇文章见证了我们共同的努力，并以此文，作别2017年。Also, keep in mind that this post is not a classic "best of" list, just a collection that shows how amazing the Node community was in 2017! I figured that a big shoutout to the developers who constantly advocate & teach Node would be a great way to say goodbye to this year.好了，别废话了，回到主题，我会依次阐述node在2017年的发展：So, here come the proof I promised in the title:## 1\. 我们有了无比实用的node实践项目清单：## 1\. We have insanely useful community curated lists:如果你想快速学习node的知识，你可以考虑下node社区。这些清单都创建于2017年，并且包含了许多最佳实践和捷径，你可以通过它们来检验自己的node技能水平。If you'd like to gain useful knowledge quickly, you can count on the Node community. These lists were created in 2017, and contain so much best practices & shortcuts that you can definitely level up your skills by going through them.*   [node.js最佳实践](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices) 本GitHub项目，均取自从node排行的榜首文章，并会持续更新。*   is curated from the top ranked articles and always updated.*   [棒极了的Node.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs)    是一个内容涵盖范围广、质量高的node模块包和相关资源的清单。is an extensive list of delightful Node packages & resources.*   [最新JS备忘录](https://github.com/mbeaudru/modern-js-cheatsheet)   包含了构建最新web项目的知识。 contains knwledge needed to build modern projects.**以上项目，均在GitHub聚集了超过300位贡献者，并获得了约50k的stars！****These lists have over 300 contributors & gained around 50K stars on GitHub!**另外，我推荐以下两篇来自 Yoni Goldberg 和 Azat Mardan 的文章，它们能帮助你成为一个更好的开发者：Also, we recommend to check out these articles written by Yoni Goldberg & Azat Mardan which will help you to become a better developer:*   [node.js生产最佳实践](http://goldbergyoni.com/checklist-best-practice-of-node-js-in-production/)*   [10个node.js最佳实践 : 来自node专家的启发](https://www.sitepoint.com/node-js-best-practices-from-the-node-gurus/)## 2\. 通过实例深刻理解node.jsThere are actually insightful Case Studies available!谈及2017年node实践的最优秀的文章，就一定要提的一篇是，作为一名五年的node.js开发者，Scott Nonnenberg在2017年4月写的一篇关于用node.js的经验总结。[作为5年的node开发者，谈谈我的经验。](https://blog.scottnonnenberg.com/hard-won-lessons-five-years-with-node-js/)这篇文章讨论了一些基本概念，项目建构问题，测试，node的生态圈，以及你为什么不应该用New Relic(译者注：一个性能检测工具) 。> “我曾分享过一些学习node的小故事，但这篇文章将主要关注于我学习过程中走过的那些弯路。如遇到的bug、面对的挑战、邂逅的惊喜。并且我希望，你从这篇文章中学到的东西你可以应用到你自己的项目中去。” —— Scott> "I’ve already shared a few stories, but this time I wanted to focus on the ones I learned the hard way. Bugs, challenges, surprises, and the lessons you can apply to your own projects!" - Scott..**此外，你知道吗，node.js也应用到NASA（译者注：美国宇航局）的项目中，以保障宇航员的安全。这事儿实在是太酷了！****Also, did you know that Node.js Helps NASA to Keep Astronauts Safe?** It's hard to come up with something cooler than that.NASA选用node.js，有以下原因：NASA choose Node.js for the following reasons:*   使用**JavaScript**开发数据传输程序相对容易，同时一种编程语言可以完成整套程序，这使得**开发省钱省时。***   The relative ease of developing data transfer applications with **JavaScript**, and the familiarity across the organization with the programming language, which **keeps development time and costs low.***   用于I/O操作的Node.js异步事件循环，使之成为了**云数据库系统完美解决方案**，它可以从数十名立即发起数据请求的用户那儿收到请求。*   Node.js’ asynchronous event loop for I/O operations makes it **the perfect solution for a cloudbased database system** that sees queries from dozens of users who need data immediately.*   **作为Node.js的包管理器，npm与Docker匹配地出乎意料地优秀，可以创建一个微服务架构。**能使每一个API，函数和应用程序都平稳、独立地运行。*   The Node.js package manager, **npm, pairs incredibly well with Docker to create a microservices architecture** that allows each API, function and application to operate smoothly and independently.想了解更多，可以阅读全文 [NASA关于Node.js的实践](https://foundation.nodejs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2017/09/Node_CaseStudy_Nasa_FNL.pdf)同时，我向node基金会建议，定期去整理和宣传这些优秀用例。_Also, shoutout to the Node Foundation who started to assemble and distribute these pretty [白皮书：Node.js的有趣用例](https://foundation.nodejs.org/resources)## 3\. 2017年，Node.js在安全领域和身份验证上也有了成就：## 3\. Node.js Authentication & Security was well covered in 2017:当你打算构建一个Node.js应用（或任何程序）安全性常是至关重要的。这就是为什么micaksica写的When it comes to building Node.js apps (or any app..) security is crucial to get right. This is the reason why "[你的Node.js身份验证教程（也许）是错的](https://hackernoon.com/your-node-js-authentication-tutorial-is-wrong-f1a3bf831a46)" written by micaksica got so much attention on HackerNoon.在HackerNoon网站上获得了巨大关注的原因。> 简而言之，作者在试图寻找一个关于Node.js或者Express.js的身份认证教程。但他发现网上的这些文章都是不完善的，或者在某方面会造成安全问题，从而影响那些新的学习者。而这篇文章，作者则讲述了一些常见的身份认证的陷阱，以及如何避免它们，和在教程无法给你提供帮助时，你要怎么做。> tl;dr: The author went on a search of Node.js/Express.js authentication tutorials. All of them were incomplete or made a security mistake in some way that can potentially hurt new users. His post explores some common authentication pitfalls, how to avoid them, and what to do to help yourself when your tutorials don’t help you anymore.如果你打算只阅读一篇与web安全相关的文章，这篇文章绝对是最好的选择之一！If you plan on reading only one security related article (..but why would you do that?!), this is definitely one of the best ones!..此外，我推荐github上的这个仓库：Also, we recommend to check out the [啊，脆弱的Node.js应用！](https://github.com/appsecco/dvna) github page, which aims to demonstrate the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities and guides you on fixing and avoiding these vulnerabilities.这个仓库通过几个demo，旨在展示OWASP（开放式Web应用程序安全项目）提出的十大漏洞，并指导你如何修复或者避免这些漏洞。..还有一些文章也在2017年获得了好评，如：Other great articles which were receiving a lot of praise were [使用JSON Web Token来保护Node.js RESTful API](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/securing-node-js-restful-apis-with-json-web-tokens-9f811a92bb52) by Adnan Rahic, and [Node.js的双重因素身份认证](https://davidwalsh.name/2fa) from David Walsh.## 4\.使用Node.js进行api的开发，正变得更加简单## 4\. API development with Node.js has been made even more easy:Node.js的一个主要优点是，可以用一种非常有效的方式来构建REST API。 关于这个话题有很多文章，但这些绝对是最受欢迎的文章：One of the main strengths of Node.js is that you can build REST APIs with it in a very efficient way! There are a lot of articles covering that topic, but these were definitely the most popular ones:*   [运用Node.js设计 RESTful API](https://hackernoon.com/restful-api-design-with-node-js-26ccf66eab09) walks beginners through the whole process in a very thorough, easy to understand way. 通过一个相当简单易懂的方式，让初学者了解rest  api设计的全过程。*   [仅需30分钟，带你构建一个Node.js API](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-a-simple-node-js-api-in-under-30-minutes-a07ea9e390d2) 这篇文章也很优秀，同时它用的是es6的语法。*   [编写Node.js REST API的10个最佳实践](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/10-best-practices-for-writing-node-js-rest-apis-7643a7765cd) (这篇文章是我们写的，也就是medium.com) 这篇文章更深入了一步，包括路由命名，身份验证，黑盒测试，以及对资源进行缓存等主题。## 5\. We're constantly looking under the hood of Node.js.Luckily, the Node/JS community delivers when you want to go deeper, in fact there were so many interesting deep-dives that it was really hard to pick out the best ones, but one can try! These articles are really insightful:*   [理解Node.js的事件驱动架构](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-node-js-event-driven-architecture-223292fcbc2d)*   [关于Node.js的事件环，这些你必须知道](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/what-you-should-know-to-really-understand-the-node-js-event-loop-and-its-metrics-c4907b19da4c)*   [这些关于Node.js的stream模块的事，你必须知道](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/node-js-streams-everything-you-need-to-know-c9141306be93)*   [JavaScript是怎么在V8引擎里工作的? & 五个编写优质代码的技巧](https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-inside-the-v8-engine-5-tips-on-how-to-write-optimized-code-ac089e62b12e)*   [ECMAScript 2017（ES8）发布！这儿是它的的主要新功能](https://hackernoon.com/es8-was-released-and-here-are-its-main-new-features-ee9c394adf66)*   [六个Async/Await取代Promises的原因（教程）](https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9)     [→neal1991国语翻译版本](https://github.com/neal1991/articles-translator/blob/master/Javascript%E4%B8%ADAsync-Await%E4%BC%98%E4%BA%8EPromise%E7%9A%846%E4%B8%AA%E5%8E%9F%E5%9B%A0.md)_在你看来，讲解NS/Node底层的文章哪篇最优秀呢？欢迎在评论中分享！__What were the best articles that peeked under the hood of JS/Node in your opinion? Share them in the comments!_## 6\.在2017年，那些让人惊喜的Node.js工具## 6\. Awesome new Tools were made in 2017:在这一年中，最流行的两个工具是Two of the most hyped tools of the year were [Prettier](http://jlongster.com/prettier-1.0) & [Fastify](https://thenewstack.io/introducing-fastify-speedy-node-js-web-framework/)!如果你还不了解他们，我可以简单介绍一下：prettier是一个js格式化工具，通过编译代码至AST语法树，再在AST语法树中输出漂亮的格式化后的代码。In case you don't know, prettier is a JavaScript formatter that works by compiling your code to an AST, and then pretty-printing the AST.> 无论此前代码是谁写的，谁维护的，经过prettier处理，所有的代码都一样好看。通常，程序员会花大量时间在调节代码格式以及争论那种样式更优秀，而这个工具解决了这个问题。> The result is good-looking code that is completely consistent no matter who wrote it. This solves the problem of programmers spending a lot of time manually moving around code in their editor and arguing about styles.Fastify是由由Node.js核心技术委员会成员Matteo Collina在2017年温哥华的Node Interactive会议上发布的。Fastify was introduced by Matteo Collina, Node.js core technical commitee member during Node Interactive 2017 in Vancouver.> Fastify是一个全新的web服务器框架，它的出现受到了Hapi, Restify 和 Express的启发。Fastify是作为一个通用的Web框架构建的，但是当构建使用JSON作为数据格式的HTTP API时，它的速度上的优势，将显得非常明显。> Fastify is a new web framework inspired by Hapi, Restify and Express. Fastify is built as a general-purpose web framework, but it shines when building extremely fast HTTP APIs that use JSON as the data format...当然，这里我们就先提这么多吧。..just to mention a few.## 7\. There are Amazing Crash Courses Available for FreeIf you'd like to start learning Node, you can count on the commmunity to deliver free, high-quality resources that can speed up your journey!One particular author - Adnan Rahić - received a huge amount of praise for releasing crash courses for different topics on Medium. Here they are:*   [A crash course on testing with Node.js](https://hackernoon.com/a-crash-course-on-testing-with-node-js-6c7428d3da02)*   [A crash course on Serverless with Node.js](https://hackernoon.com/a-crash-course-on-serverless-with-node-js-632b37d58b44)We hope Adnan will continue this series and create crash courses on other areas of Node as well!## 8\. Miscellaneous Topics are Covered as WellWhat do we mean under miscellaneous topics? Well, those are topics that go beyond the "traditional" use cases of Node.js, where the authors describe something interesting & fun they built with it.For example there were exceptional articles released that used the OpenCV library for either [face recognition](https://medium.com/@muehler.v/node-js-opencv-for-face-recognition-37fa7cb860e8) or just regular [object recognition](https://community.risingstack.com/opencv-tutorial-computer-vision-with-node-js/).Chatbots were a hype topic too, and there was no shortage of blogposts describing how to build them using different languages.[Building A Simple AI Chatbot With Web Speech API And Node.js](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/08/ai-chatbot-web-speech-api-node-js/) was one of the most praised articles. In this post Tomomi Imura walked us through building a chat-bot which can be controlled by voice. Yep, it's pretty cool.We also recommend to check out [Developing A Chatbot Using Microsoft's Bot Framework, LUIS And Node.js](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/chatbot-microsoft-bot-framework-luis-nodejs-part1/) too, which is the first part of a series dealing with the topic._What other fun projects did you see? Add them to the comments section!_## 9\. The community can attend great conferences, like Node Interactive!Node Interactive Vancouver was a major event which provided great opportunities for it's attendees to meet with fellow developers & learn a lot about their favorite subject.Fortunately [every prezentation is available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfMzBWSH11xa-iNnQG2555lgi4574nZOh), so you can get up-to-date even if you couldn't participate this year (just like us.)The 10 most watched right now are:*   [Node.js Performance and Highly Scalable Micro-Services](https://youtu.be/Fbhhc4jtGW4) by Chris Bailey*   [New DevTools Features for JavaScript](https://youtu.be/dbCcVzt9C1c) by Yang Guo*   [The V8 Engine and Node.js](https://youtu.be/PsDqH_RKvyc) by Franzi Hinkelmann*   [High Performance JS in V8](https://youtu.be/YqOhBezMx1o) by Peter Marshall*   [The Node.js Event Loop: Not So Single Threaded](https://youtu.be/zphcsoSJMvM) by Bryan Hughes*   [Welcome and Node.js Update](https://youtu.be/glB15kDpMl0) by Mark Hinkle*   [Take Your HTTP Server to Ludicrous Speed](https://youtu.be/gltzZjKYK1I) by Matteo Collina*   [WebAssembly and the Future of the Web](https://youtu.be/iJL59lh4IJA) by Athan Reines*   [High Performance Apps with JavaScript and Rust](https://youtu.be/Pfbw4YPrwf4) by Amir Yasin*   [TypeScript - A Love Tale with JavaScript](https://youtu.be/9YOHg3rt3W8) by Bowden KellyOf course this list is just the tip of the iceberg, since there are 54 videos upladed on the Node Foundations' YouTube channel, and most of them are really insightful and fun to watch.## 10\. Node.js is finally more sought after than Java!Although Ryan Dahl recently stated in an [interview](https://www.mappingthejourney.com/single-post/2017/08/31/Episode-8-Interview-with-Ryan-Dahl-Creator-of-Nodejs) that..> for a certain class of application, which is like, if you're building a server, I can't imagine using anything other than Go... we have no reason to doubt the success of Node.js!Mikeal Rogers, one of the core organizers of NodeConf, community manager & core contributor at the Node Foundation stated that **Node.js will overtake Java within a year** in a [NewStack interview this summer](https://thenewstack.io/open-source-profile-mikeal-rogers-node-js/)!> We are now at about 8 million estimated users and still growing at about 100 percent a year.  We haven’t passed Java in terms of users yet, but by this time next year at the current growth, we will surpass. - Mikeal.Mikeal is not alone with his opinion. There is hard data available to prove that Node is becoming more sought after than Java.According to the data gathered by builtinnode, the demand for Node.js developers has already surpassed the demand for Java devs by the summer of 2017 in the Who is Hiring section of Hacker News!![Demand for Node.js Developers surpassed demand for Java Developers](http://p0.qhimg.com/t01c3104a4fd943f931.png)Since Node was already adopted and is being advocated by the greatest tech companies on Earth, there's no doubt that it will remain a leading technology for many years ahead!**We hope that the Node community will continue to thrive in 2018 as well, and produce a plethora of exellent tools & tutorials.**At RisingStack, we'll keep on advocating & educating Node in 2018 as well, for sure!
